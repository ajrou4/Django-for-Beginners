pip install -r requirements.txt
cd <project-name>


## To run any project:
python manage.py runserver

📦 Deployment

Some of these apps were also deployed using Heroku to get a feel for production environments.
If you'd like to deploy them too, follow Heroku’s deployment steps for Django.
🧭 Next Steps

Now that I've completed Django for Beginners, I plan to continue my Django journey with:

Django for APIs – to learn Django REST Framework and build APIs

Django for Professionals – to learn Docker, PostgreSQL, CI/CD, and scalable deployments

    Building my own Django projects to reinforce what I’ve learned
